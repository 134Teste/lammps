LAMMPS Fortran Module
*********************

The LAMMPS module provides an interface to call LAMMPS from a Fortran
code.  It is based on the C-library interface and requires a Fortran
2003 compatible compiler to be compiled.  Similar to the LAMMPS Python
wrapper it provides an object oriented interface through using type
bound procedures.  Below is a minimal example:

.. code-block:: fortran

   PROGRAM testlib
     USE LIBLAMMPS                 ! include the LAMMPS library interface
     TYPE(lammps)     :: lmp       ! derived type to hold LAMMPS instance
     CHARACTER(len=*), DIMENSION(5), PARAMETER :: args = &
         [ CHARACTER(len=12) :: 'liblammps',&
          '-echo', 'both', '-log', 'log.fortran' ]

     ! create a LAMMPS instance (and initialize MPI)
     lmp = lammps(args)
     ! read commands from a file
     CALL lmp%file('in.melt')
     ! execute a single command
     CALL lmp%command('run 100 post no')
     ! delete LAMMPS instance (and shut down MPI)
     CALL lmp%close(.true.)

   END PROGRAM testlib

To compile and link Fortran code with the LAMMPS library, you need to
compile the Fortran library module (source code is located in
``examples/COUPLE/fortran/lammps.f90``) alongside your own Fortran code
and then link it with your code and also :doc:`link to the LAMMPS
library <Build_link>`.  A typical command line would be:

.. code-block:: bash

   mpifort -o testlib.x  lammps.f90 testlib.f90 -L. -llammps

Please note, that the MPI compiler wrapper is only required when the
calling the library from an MPI parallel code or when the LAMMPS library
was compiled with MPI support.

--------------------

.. f:type:: lammps

   Derived type that is the general class of the Fortran interface.
   It holds a reference to the :cpp:class:`LAMMPS <LAMMPS_NS::LAMMPS>` class instance
   that any of the included calls are forwarded to.

   :f c_ptr handle: reference to the LAMMPS class
   :f close: :f:func:`close`
   :f version: :f:func:`version`
   :f file: :f:func:`file`
   :f command: :f:func:`command`

.. f:function:: lammps(args[,comm])

   This is the constructor for the Fortran class and will forward
   the arguments to a call to either :cpp:func:`lammps_open_fortran`
   or :cpp:func:`lammps_open_no_mpi`. If the LAMMPS library has been
   compiled with MPI support, it will also initialize MPI, if it has
   not already been initialized before.

   The *args* argument with the list of command line parameters is
   optional and so it the *comm* argument with the MPI communicator.
   If *comm* is not provided, ``MPI_COMM_WORLD`` is assumed. For
   more details please see the documentation of :cpp:func:`lammps_open`.

   :p character(len=*) args() [optional]: arguments as list of strings
   :o integer comm [optional]: MPI communicator
   :r lammps: an instance of the :f:type:`lammps` derived type

.. f:subroutine:: close([finalize])

   This method will close down the LAMMPS instance through calling
   :cpp:func:`lammps_close`.  If the *finalize* argument is present and
   has a value of ``.true.``, then this subroutine also calls
   :cpp:func:`lammps_mpi_finalize`.

   :o logical finalize [optional]: shut down the MPI environment of the LAMMPS library if true.

.. f:function:: version()

   This method returns the numeric LAMMPS version like :cpp:func:`lammps_version`

   :r integer: LAMMPS version

.. f:subroutine:: file(filename)

   This method will call :cpp:func:`lammps_file` to have LAMMPS read
   and process commands from a file.

   :p character(len=*) filename: name of file with LAMMPS commands

.. f:subroutine:: command(cmd)

   This method will call :cpp:func:`lammps_command` to have LAMMPS
   execute a single command.

   :p character(len=*) cmd: LAMMPS command
