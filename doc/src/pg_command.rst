LAMMPS Command Classes
**********************

In LAMMPS most commands are implemented as classes
derived from the :ref:`Pointers <lammps_ns_pointers>`
class which have to contain a ``command()`` method.
Creating the class instance corresponds to an
input file command and its arguments are passed
to the ``command()`` which will then execute the
command.
