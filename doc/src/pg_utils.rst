LAMMPS utils library functions
******************************

The ``utils`` namespace provides a collection of convenience functions
and utilities that perform common tasks that are required repeatedly
throughout the LAMMPS code like reading or writing to files with error
checking or translation of strings into specific types of numbers with
checking for validity.  This reduces redundant implementations and
enhances consistent behavior.
