LAMMPS C++ base classes
***********************

LAMMPS is designed to be used as a C++ class library
where one can set up and drive a simulation through
creating a class instance and then calling some abstract
operations or commands on that class or its member class
instances.  These are interfaced to the
:doc:`C library API <pg_library>`, which providing an
additional level of abstraction simplification for
common operations. The C API is also the basis for
calling LAMMPS from Python or Fortran.  Behind the
scenes this is implemented through inheritance and
polymorphism where base classes define the abstract
interface and derived classes provide the specialized
implementation for specific models or optimizations or
ports to accelerator platforms.  This document will
provide an outline of the fundamental class hierarchy
and some selected examples for derived classes of
specific models.

   Please see the :ref:`note about thread-safety <thread-safety>`
   in the library Howto doc page.

   LAMMPS class topology

   This figure shows some of the relations of the base classes of the
   LAMMPS simulation package.  Full lines indicate that a class holds an
   instance of the class it is pointing to; dashed lines point to
   derived classes that are given as examples of what classes may be
   instantiated during a LAMMPS run based on the input commands and
   accessed through the API define by their respective base classes.  At
   the core is the :cpp:class:`LAMMPS <LAMMPS_NS::LAMMPS>` class, which
   holds pointers to class instances with specific purposes.  Those may
   hold instances of other classes, sometimes directly, or only
   temporarily, sometimes as derived classes or derived classes or
   derived classes, which may also hold instances of other classes.
