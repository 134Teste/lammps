[Description:]

This fix applies the Multi-Scale Coarse-Graining (MSCG) package to snapshots
from a dump file to generates potentials for coarse-grained simulations from
all-atom simulations using a force-matching technique ("Izvekov"_#Izvekov,
"Noid"_#Noid).

The general workflow for the MSCG package is as follows: (1) Perform all-atom
simulations on the system to be coarse grianed. (2) Generate a trajectory
mapped to the coarse-grained model. (3) Create input files for the MSCG code.
(4) Run the range finder functionality of the MSCG package. (5) Run the force
matching functionality of the MSCG package. (6) Check the results of the force
matching. (7) Run coarse-grained simulations using the generated coarse-grained
potentials.

This fix is set up to run the range finding and force matching functions
(steps 4 and 5) of the above workflow using the "rerun"_rerun.html command.
The dump file provided for the rerun should contain the positions and forces
of the coarse-grained beads mapped from an all-atom trajectory. An additional
input file (control.in) is needed by the MSCG package to set the parameters
for the range finding and force matching functionalities. See the documentation
provided with the MSCG package for more info.

The MSCG package also provides additional output files when using this fix.
The range finder functionality outputs files defining pair and bonded
interaction ranges. The force matching functionality outputs tabulated force
files for every interaction in the system. Other diagnostic files can also be
output depending on the paramters in the input script. See the documentation
provided with the MSCG package for more info.

This fix makes use of the MSCG library, which is maintained by Gregory Voth's
group at the University of Chicago. See instructions on obtaining and installing
the MSCG library in the src/USER-MSCG/README file.

:line

The {range} keyword specifies which MSCG functionality should be performed. If
{on}, the range finder functionality is performed. If {off}, the force matching
functionality is performed.

If the {name} keyword is used, string names are defined to associate with the
integer atom types in LAMMPS. A list of space separated names should be
provided for each atom type (1-N).

The {max} keyword specifies the maximum number of bonds, angles, and dihedrals
a bead can have in the current coarse-grained model.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-MSCG package. It is only enabled if LAMMPS was
built with that package. See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3
section for more info.

The MSCG library uses C++11, which may not be supported by older compilers. The
MSCG library also has some dependencies, which are describd in the documentation
included with that package.

Currently, the MSCG library is not set up to run with mpi, so this fix can only
be used with serial runs.
